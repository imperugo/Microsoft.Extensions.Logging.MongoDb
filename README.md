# Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.MongoDb

If you are a MongoDb addicted this is the logger for you!

This project is not a part of NET Core or ASP.NET Core and is not provider by Microsoft.
This is a logged implementation for `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` who will log into [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com).

The only reason why the name is starting with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` is for "convention" with the other loggers released by Microsoft.

**Right now is working with netstandard 1.5** [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.MongoDb.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.MongoDb/)

The package is not release yet.
Hope to push it soon on Nuget.
